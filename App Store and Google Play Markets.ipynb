The markets are already full of libraries, so we need to add some special features besides the raw version of the book.This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, a forum where people can discuss the book, and many interesting features that will make the user spend more time using the apps and watching more ads which lead to increase the revenue."
